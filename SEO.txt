ON-PAGE SEO


meta name="keywords" ...  IS NO MORE USED FOR INDEXING PAGES BY GOOGLE
meta name="description" ... is used but AFTER PAGE GETS INDEXED


Following are the few simple tips to improve search engine presence of our website
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Use keyword(s) in <title> tag. Title plays most important role in indexing.
Use <h1> for headings and <h2> for sub-headings on pages.
Shorter and meaningful urls. (e.g. https://example.com/blog-on-seo)
Maximise use of keywords in body; must in first 100 characters of body.
Internal links to other pages on our site from body [like wikipedia uses].
External links(if possible) to other websites from body.
Use CDN links for css and js which improves speed.(e.g. https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/, https://ajax.googleapis.com/)
Use Keywords in links.(e.g. <a href="#">Keyword Here</a>) 
Compress images; Use keyword(s) for image filenames and use alt attribute (e.g. <img src="seo-tips.png" alt="Seo Tips"/>)
Modifiers in the title like 'buy', 'best', 'guide', 'how'... etc
